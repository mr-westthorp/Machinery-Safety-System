RFID-based machine safety system


The project described and contained within this github is primarily aimed at school design technology workshops. The aim is to produce a system to manage and monitor the various machines available with the workshop and to ensure that only competent persons are able to use such machinery. Additionally, it will provide valuable information to help perform and record maintenance operations on the machinery.
